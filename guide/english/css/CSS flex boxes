  CSS flex boxes is a way to dinamicly positon itmes on your webpage.
If you hard coded in a header on your website with a with of 100px it might look good on your monitor, but on a smaler devices you would 
have to scroll to one side. With CSS flex boxes you can make a header that goes from one side to the other, and on a smaller divice it 
still goes from one side to the other.

  You can have the itmes in the header equally grow and shrink with the header, or have for instenc the home and blog itmes shrince but not 
the searchbar.You can easily control the growth and shrinkage of any itmes in the searchbar.
  CSS flex boxes are not that hard to learn if you already know CSS but it will greatly inprove your website.
